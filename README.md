# Analyzing Mobile Usage Impact on Visual Search Performance

## Overview

This project investigates how mobile usage habits impact cognitive functions, specifically in visual search tasks. By analyzing the correlation between mobile usage and the efficiency of visual target identification, we aim to understand the effects of age, gender, and daily mobile usage on cognitive response times. Utilizing a multifaceted statistical approach, this study leverages Jupyter Notebook and various data visualization tools to provide insights into these correlations.

## Objectives

To explore the relationship between daily mobile usage and visual search performance.

To assess the impact of demographic variables such as age and gender on visual search efficiency.

To apply statistical analysis techniques to identify potential correlations and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

## Mathematics and Statistics

The project employs several statistical methodologies and mathematical concepts, including:

Frequency distribution analysis to understand mobile usage patterns.

Linear and multiple regression analysis to predict visual search performance based on mobile usage and demographic variables.

ANOVA tests to examine differences in visual search performance across various groups.

## Implementation

### Libraries and Packages

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

Seaborn and Matplotlib for comprehensive data visualization.

Scikit-Learn for implementing linear regression models.

SciPy and StatsModels for conducting statistical testing, including ANOVA.

## Methodology

The project focuses on:

Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Building prediction models to explore the impact of mobile usage on visual search tasks.

Conducting hypothesis testing to validate the findings and draw conclusions.

## Outcomes

This section outlines the key findings from each analysis task, detailing the impact of mobile usage patterns on cognitive response times and how these are influenced by age and gender.

## Challenges and Resolutions

### Challenges
